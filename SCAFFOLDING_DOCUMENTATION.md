## üöÄ Getting Started

### Demo Page
Visit `/demo` to see all scaffolded features in action with interactive examples.

### Admin Dashboard
Visit `/admin` to access the admin dashboard (requires admin role setup).

### Integration with Existing App
All components are designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing Shadow Bind application:

1. **Chat Component**: Can be integrated into any page by importing and passing `userId` and `chatId`
2. **File Upload**: Can be embedded in chat interfaces or profile pages
3. **User Profile**: Can be used for user settings pages or profile viewing
4. **Group Chat**: Can be accessed as a dedicated chat section
5. **Notifications**: Settings can be integrated into user preferences
6. **Search**: Can be added to any messaging interface
7. **Admin**: Provides system management capabilities

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` for full functionality:
```env
# Firebase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Push Notifications (TODO: Add when implementing)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
```

### Firestore Security Rules
Update your Firestore security rules to support the new collections:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Chat messages
    match /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // User profiles
    match /users/{userId}/profile/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if resource.data.preferences.publicProfile == true;
    }
    
    // Groups
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.members[request.auth.uid].role in ['owner', 'admin'];
    }
    
    // Admin (restrict to admin users only)
    match /admin/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admin/users/$(request.auth.uid));
    }
    
    // Search index
    match /search-index/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      // Write access should be handled by Cloud Functions
    }
  }
}
```

### Firebase Storage Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /uploads/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /profile-images/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Code Quality
- All components include comprehensive error handling
- TypeScript-ready (can be easily converted)
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Accessibility considerations included
- Performance optimizations noted in TODOs

### Testing Strategy
Each component should be tested for:
- Authentication state handling
- Firebase configuration scenarios
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Mobile and desktop responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance

### Deployment Considerations
- All features work with existing Firebase project
- No breaking changes to current functionality
- Gradual rollout possible (features can be enabled individually)
- Production-ready error handling and fallbacks
